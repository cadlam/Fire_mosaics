# Discussion

This study found that management options that mitigate the risk of high severity fires by reducing canopy cover and continuity were also favorable to enhanced biodiversity outcomes for birds, plants, and lichens. Diversity for all three taxa was as high or higher in multiple burns and thin+burn plots, which provided habitat for species associated with both high severity burns and dense, long-unburnt or low severity burn stands. Low severity burns were not linked to a detectable change in species composition compared with long-unburnt stands. These stands had similar to lower diversity in birds, plants, lichens and insects compared with high severity burn patches. Management that aims to mitigate the risk of high severity fire by reducing canopy cover to 30-60% can also meet biodiversity objectives by accommodating both early- and late-seral associated species.

This finding is encouraging given the focus on increasing the pace and scale of forest restoration across the West [@charnleyAllLandsApproaches2016]. Recent policy priorities have emphasized the expansion of forest restoration, while collaborative landscape restoration partnerships such as the WKRP have been building grassroots momentum and multi-stakeholder consensus for such projects [@harlingWesternKlamathRestoration2014]. In addition to the goal of reducing the risk of high severity fires, such treatments aim to address the threat to biodiversity from fire suppression, which has reduced successional diversity and areas of open forest. These were once much more widespread due to historically frequent, low severity fires, particularly in areas with a high level of ignitions from Native Americans [@metlenRegionalLocalControls2018; @taylorSocioecologicalTransitionsTrigger2016; @crawfordLateHoloceneFire2015]. Restoring a more open forest structure is expected to increase diversity in understory plants [@waymanInitialResponseMixedconifer2007; @websterLongtermVegetationResponses2010] and birds [@gainesShortTermEffectsThinning2010; @gainesShortTermResponseLand2007; @kaliesStandStructureBreeding2013]. Many studies have documented an increase in diversity at intermediate disturbance and canopy levels [@richterSpeciesDiversityFire2019], although it is unclear whether this tends to benefit early-seral or late-seral associated species. In contrast, some researchers have noted the benefits of high severity fire for many species and suggested that forest restoration could damage habitat used by late-seral associates while creating conditions that are unsuitable for species associated with post-fire early-seral habitats [@odionExaminingHistoricalCurrent2014]. This study demonstrates that actively or passively restored stands are more diverse precisely because they accommodate both species associated with denser forests, and those associated with high severity patches.

Despite a recent increase in the size and prevalence of high severity burn patches [@taylorFireHistoryLandscape1998; @stevensChangingSpatialPatterns2017], fire frequency remains significantly below historic levels across much of the landscape in the Klamath Mountains [@fryInfluenceHumansClimate2006; @taylorFireHistoryLandscape1998; @steelFireFrequencyseverityRelationship2015]. In other ecoregions with forests with low and mixed severity fire regimes, fire suppression has caused sharp increases in canopy cover. Mixed conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada had a canopy cover of ~25% in early 20th century [@stephensHistoricalCurrentLandscapescale2015], and similar figures have been given based on reference conditions, historical data and modelling [@fornwaltUsingForestVegetation1998; @stephensCoarseWoodyDebris2007]. While precise estimates of historical canopy cover are lacking for the Klamath Mountains, it is clear that open forests have been lost across the region due to fire suppression, leading to a more homogenous, denser forest [@taylorSpatialPatternsControls2003a].

In this study, stands where fire had been excluded had the lowest plant species richness and the smallest pool of species for both birds and plants. Only select groups of species appear to prefer these conditions, including shade-tolerant plants and bark-gleaning and canopy-dwelling bird species. Fire-sensitive species, including all lichens and a small number of plants (eg. *Goodyera oblongifolia*) were also associated with these stands and absent from high severity burns (lichens began to recolonize as early as 16 years after a high severity burn). Meanwhile, the latter were home to a variety of shade-intolerant grasses, shrubs and forbs, and open area, shrub-nesting and cavity-nesting bird species that were found rarely, if ever, in unburnt stands. Several taxa of insect pollinators and herbivores were also strongly associated with high severity burns. Arthropods are an important part of the diet of many bird species, and their increase after fires may favor insectivorous birds [@seavySongbirdResponseWildfire2014]. Early-seral habitats created by fire are recognized for their importance to many taxa, including rare species [@swansonBiologicalAssociatesEarlyseral2014]. While the species of denser, fire-suppressed stands and those of post-fire early seral habitats are largely segregated in today's forested landscape, this pattern may not be representative of historical conditions in which finer-scale heterogeneity was prevalent [@taylorSpatialPatternsControls2003a; @hanberryOpenForestEcosystems2020]. However, few studies have clarified whether reductions in canopy cover following lower severity burns, multiple burns or thin+burn treatments can allow for these two species cohorts to coexist within stands. 

However, the sharp distinction between the species communities of denser forests and high severity patches was not significantly altered by the occurrence of low severity fire. While it might have been expected that surface fires would play a restorative role in fire-suppressed stands (leading to an increase in shade-intolerant species for example), the small magnitude of the reduction in canopy cover after a low severity burn was insufficient to achieve this result. Other studies in mixed conifer forest have suggested that a considerable reduction in canopy cover (to 30-50%) is necessary before understory richness can be expected to increase [@abellaEffectsTreeCutting2015]. Douglas-firs (and white firs at higher elevations) are unlikely to be thinned by surface fires, particularly once they have reached 30cm dbh [@beckerCanLowseverityFire2016; @collinsImpactsFireExclusion2011; @knappLongtermOverstoryUnderstory2013]. Trees that have grown since fire-suppression began have reached this fire-resistant size in the productive forests of the Klamath Mountains. Since low severity fires are not significantly changing forest structure and species composition, management options that restore a lower canopy cover need to be considered.

The multiple burns and thin+burn stands in this study had a canopy cover of 30-75% (mean = 48%, sd = 15%), and were associated with the highest levels of species richness for birds and plants. Lichen species richness was also similar to that of the low severity and unburnt stands. I also found that canopy cover was negatively associated with bird and plant species richness within these habitats. Canopy cover is recognized as a key driver of species diversity [@stephensCoarseWoodyDebris2007; @stevensFireSeverityChanging2019], and my findings echo the suggestion by Abella and Springer tha ta reduction in canopy cover to 30-50% is needed to achieve significant increases in species diversity [@abellaEffectsTreeCutting2015]. When management results in this level of canopy cover, species typically restricted to high severity burns and those that occur in denser mature forests can coexist in a single stand. 

Managing wildfires for resource benefit is a strategy that is recommended for its outcomes for bird diversity [@stephensFireSeverityAffects2015; @fontaineBirdCommunitiesFollowing2009], plant diversity [@laughlinReferenceConditionsWildfire2004], and ecosystem resilience [@barrosWildfiresManagedRestoration2018; @boisrameVegetationChange40years2017; @nesmithComparisonEffectsPrescribed2011]. While there has been a focus on the capacity of high severity reburns to perpetuate "non-forest" vegetation conditions [@odionAlternativeCommunityStates2010; @tepleyVulnerabilityForestLoss2017; @thompsonFactorsAssociatedCrown2010], low to moderate severity multiple burns can also increase fine-scale heterogeneity by creating multi-layered stands with canopy cover levels intermediate between unburnt (and low severity) stands and high severity burns. I found that such areas represent biodiversity hotspots on the landscape because the structure of these stands accommodated both fire-sensitive species (e.g. lichens) and fire-dependent species (eg. shade-intolerant herbaceous plants and shrub-nesting birds). 

Thinned and burnt stands achieved the same result, particularly when there had been a significant reduction in canopy cover. As was the case for the multiple burns, I focused my sampling on stands with a canopy cover of 30-70%. This represents a important reduction in canopy cover and may not represent standard underburn operations, which may make little impact on stand structure and thus biodiversity [@seavyMeasuringEcologicalEffects2006]. But this study joins others in highlighting the ecological benefits of higher severity burns, or at least treatments that include patches of high severity [@fuleEffectsIntensePrescribed2004; @stephensEffectsForestFuelReduction2012]. Just like low severity burns in this study, treatments that maintain a high canopy cover are unlikely to stimulate a response of understory diversity. Despite the potential benefits of treating stands to reverse the effects of fire exclusion, such treatments remain very scarce in the study region. This led to some sacrifices in sampling rigor (eg. sites were more spatially clustered), and as a result caution is needed in interpreting some of the results (eg. lower beta diversity in the thin+burn stands). More importantly, while the results are encouraging, the vanishingly small footprint of active forest restoration brings into question the ability for agencies to deploy such treatments on the scale that is needed. The footprint of wildfires, including reburns, exceeds active management by a considerable margin. Much more widespread restoration efforts will be needed, for example through collaborative approaches such as the WKRP, and wildland fire use should also be embraced as an alternative when conditions allow. In the meantime, umplanned ignitions, including high severity burn patches, are critical to the maintenance of biodiversity in the fire suppressed forests of the Klamath Mountains.

This study had other weaknesses aside from the difficulty in finding acceptable actively restored stands. The number of samples and variation associated with complex topographic and environmental factors did not allow for an in-depth analysis of the role of time-since-fire, which may have masked the response of some species [@smuckerChangesBirdAbundance2005]. Scale-related challenges are common in ecological research, and this study was no exception, taking into account only stand-level variables but leaving out potentially important landscape patterns [@bettsThresholdsForestBird2010]. Lastly, it would be useful to more thoroughly investigate the full range of outcomes from multiple burns and thin+burn treatments, including quantifying their spatial extent. This study joins others in showing that positive biodiversity outcomes are possible under some conditions, but to what extent these are realized remains to be determined. Despite these caveats, this study has clear and important management implications.

## Management implications

Fire suppressed stands have similar or lower plant and bird diversity (alpha, beta, gamma diversity) than high severity burn burns, and low severity burns do not appear to change this pattern. While high severity burns are important for biodiversity when compared with unburnt/low severity stands, species that are associated with both of these habitats also favor multiple burns and prescribed burns. As a result, such stands are more diverse than either high severity burns or (especially) unburnt/low severity burn stands. This suggests that both active (thin+burn) and passive (wildland fire use) management can achieve biodiversity conservation goals while also achieving fuels reduction and forest and community resilience objectives. Fuels reduction treatments can be conducted in a way that benefits biodiversity [@dodsonDryConiferousForest2010; @dodsonUnderstoryVegetationResponse2008; @waymanInitialResponseMixedconifer2007]. However, canopy cover and small to medium tree density must be significantly reduced to achieve such benefits [@abellaEffectsTreeCutting2015; @kaliesStandStructureBreeding2013], and repeated treatments are necessary [@goodwin15yearPosttreatmentResponse2018]. Multiple burns can achieve similar results, suggesting that wildland fire use should be used to promote diverse forests at a scale much larger than current active restoration treatments allow. In the absence of passive or active restoration, mosaics of different fire severiies, including high severity patches, are important to the maintenance of biodiversity in the fire suppressed forests of the Klamath Mountains.
