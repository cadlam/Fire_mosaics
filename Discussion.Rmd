# Discussion

Fire suppressed stands have lower biodiversity (alpha, beta, gamma diversity) than high severity burn stands, and low severity burns do not appear to change this pattern. While high severity burns are important for biodiversity when compared with unburnt/low severity stands, species that are associated with either of these habitats also favor multiple burns and prescribed burns. As a result, such stands are more diverse than either high severity burns or (especially) unburnt/low severity burn stands. This suggests that both active (thinning/burning) and passive (wildland fire use) management can achieve biodiversity conservation goals while also achieving fuels reduction and forest/community resilience objectives.
