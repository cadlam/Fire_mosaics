### Effect of fire history on species composition
The main PERMANOVA revealed that species composition varies for all taxa in response to the severity category (*p* < 0.001). Using pairwise PERMANOVAs to compare the habitats, there is no detectable difference between plant, bird or lichen communities of low severity and unburnt stands (Table 1) (plants: pseudo-*F* (~`r {2,1}`~) = H~2~O
