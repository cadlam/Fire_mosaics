# Abstract

The Klamath Mountains mixed evergreen forest is adapted to frequent, low to moderate severity fires. Today, the Karuk Tribe, US Forest Service, and local community organizations have formedthe Western Klamath Restoration Partnership to restore this fire regime, altered by a century of fire sup-pression. Part of the WKRPâ€™s mission is to address concerns about the impacts on biodiversity of both high severity fire on one hand, and the exclusion of fire on the other. First, I investigate how communities of plants, birds, lichens and insects differ between long-unburnt stands, low severity burns and high severityburns. Next I evaluate the response of diversity to two management options that can reduce canopy cover towithin its historical range: multiple burns (wildland fire use) and thinning and burning. Based on 110 plotsacross the WKRP project area, low severity burns and unburnt areas did not differ in species composition.Plant, bird and insect diversity (alpha, beta and gamma) were as high or higher in high severity burns asin low severity/unburnt stands. Lichens were negatively impacted by high severity fire, beginning to recoveronly after 16 years. Multiple burns and thinned/burnt stands were the highest in diversity, because theyprovided habitat for both species preferring high severity burns and those preferring low severity/unburntstands.  This suggests that management, whether passive (allowing fires to burn and overlap) or active(thinning and burning) can help maintain biodiversity in this fire-dependent landscape.

## Top findings (so far)

* No detectable difference in community composition between long-unburnt stands and low severity burns. This suggests that in fire-suppressed stands, fires that lead to < 25% canopy reduction do not cause a strong biodiversity response.

* Plant and bird diversity in high severity burns is as high or higher than in low severity/unburnt plots (alpha, beta and gamma diversity); almost all measures of diversity are highest in multiple burns and/or prescribed burnt plots.

  + **Alpha**: High severity burns have higher plant species richness than low severity/unburnt stands, but bird species richness is similar and lichen species richness lower. Several taxa of insect pollinators and herbivores are significantly more abundant in high severity plots than  low severity/unburnt plots. 
  + **Beta**: High severity burns are more heterogeneous than low severity/unburnt plots.
  + **Gamma**: The total species pool is lowest in low severity/unburnt stands (except for lichens).
  + **Multiple burns** and **prescribed burns** have the highest bird diversity (alpha, beta and gamma), and similar to higher plant diversity.

* A majority of species with a strong preference for either high severity burns or low severity/unburnt stands also favor multiple burn and prescribed burnt plots, suggesting that such stands can provide suitable habitat for both cohorts of species. 

## Ongoing questions
* Need to look at spatial autocorrelation (Odion 2010 suggest 2 km needed).

* Is there a better way to look at time-since-fire? I mostly ignored it here because of the high variability.

* What environmental factors mediate species response to different severities/treatments (shrub or tree cover, open space for herbaceous species, snags, tree density/size)? I have much data on stand architecture that I left out. 

* Characterize species responses by guilds/functional groups (eg. different fire-related life histories for plants, foraging guilds for birds/insects, plant floristic origins)? Are species that prefer high canopy cover more likely to be generalists, or is it the opposite?

# Introduction

After a century of fire suppression, concerns are mounting over the effect of changing fire regimes on biodiversity in Western North American forests adapted to frequent, low to moderate severity fires [@haugoMissingFireQuantifying2019; @hessburgDryForestsWildland2005]. These concerns are focused on two aspects: increasing high severity fire on one hand, and the exclusion of fire on the other. The former threatens species associated with high canopy cover and mature forests , while the latter threatens species associated with early seral habitats and open forests [@swansonBiologicalAssociatesEarlyseral2014; @odionExaminingHistoricalCurrent2014]. While there is a broad concensus that the preventing fire from playing its ecological role has been detrimental to biodiversity, there is disagreement over the relative impact of these two aspects driving changes in forest structure.

Further disagreement exists over forest management practices that managers are increasingly using in an effort to address the consequences of changing fire regimes, and to minimize the vulnerability of resources and rural communities to high severity fire. For example, thinning and burning has been criticized on the grounds that by reducing the extent of high severity fire, it might reduce the availability of ecologically-important early seral habitats, while at the same time disturbing mature forest habitats and threatening associated species [@bakerAreHighSeverityFires2015]. Meanwhile, managers are also beginning to consider letting fires burn when appropriate, which may accomplish similar goals of reducing fuel loading and canopy continuity. Understanding the impact of both active and passive forms of management is important if we are to build a consensus over how to meet both fire management and biodiversity targets. 

Such concensus is particularly needed in the context of collaborative management agreements that are becoming more an more common. For example, in the Klamath Mountains of northern California, the Karuk Tribe, United States Forest Service and community and environmental organizations have formed the Western Klamath Restoration Partnership (WKRP) in order to restore the historically low to mixed severity fire regime that prevailed prior to the disruption of Indigenous fire management [@fryInfluenceHumansClimate2006; @taylorSocioecologicalTransitionsTrigger2016; @crawfordLateHoloceneFire2015]. Extensive discussions and planning has taken place to identify zones of agreement among all the partners, such as limiting damage to communities from high severity fires and enhancing both late-seral associated species and fire-dependent, early-seral associated species [@harlingWesternKlamathRestoration2014]. But can management be adjusted to maximize all of these goals, or are they necessarily trade-offs?

In this study, I surveyed biodiverity in long-unburnt stands, low severity burns, high severity burns, thinned and burnt stands, and multiple burns. For the latter two stand types, I focused on those with intermediate canopy cover representative of forest restoration goals focused on minimizing the risk of high severity burns. To determine whether this type of management can be compatible with biodiversity conservation objectives, I ask: do areas with intermediate canopies (actively or passively managed) provide habitat for early-seral species, late-seral species, both or neither?
