# Abstract

The Klamath Mountains mixed evergreen forest is adapted to frequent, low to moderate severity fires. Today, the Karuk Tribe, US Forest Service, and local community organizations have formed the Western Klamath Restoration Partnership to restore this fire regime, altered by a century of fire suppression. One of the main tasks of the WKRP is to address concerns about the impacts to biodiversity of both high severity fire on one hand, and the exclusion of fire on the other. First, I investigate how communities of plants, birds, lichens and insects differ between long-unburnt stands, low severity burns and high severity burns. Next I evaluate the response of diversity to two management options that can reduce canopy cover towithin its historical range: multiple burns (wildland fire use) and thinning and burning. Based on 110 plotsacross the WKRP project area, low severity burns and unburnt areas did not differ in species composition.Plant, bird and insect diversity (alpha, beta and gamma) were as high or higher in high severity burns asin low severity/unburnt stands. Lichens were negatively impacted by high severity fire, beginning to recoveronly after 16 years. Multiple burns and thinned/burnt stands were the highest in diversity, because theyprovided habitat for both species preferring high severity burns and those preferring low severity/unburntstands.  This suggests that management, whether passive (allowing fires to burn and overlap) or active(thinning and burning) can help maintain biodiversity in this fire-dependent landscape.

## Top Findings

* No detectable difference in community composition between long-unburnt stands and low severity burns. This suggests that in fire-suppressed stands, fires that lead to < 25% canopy reduction do not cause a strong biodiversity response. Active management may need to reduce canopy cover much more (to 30-60%) where appropriate if conserving and restoring understory species is important.

* Plant and bird diversity in high severity burns is as high or higher than in low severity/unburnt plots (alpha, beta and gamma diversity); almost all measures of diversity are highest in multiple burns and/or prescribed burnt plots.

  + **Alpha**: High severity burns have higher plant species richness than low severity/unburnt stands, but bird species richness is similar and lichen species richness lower. Several taxa of insect pollinators and herbivores are significantly more abundant in high severity plots than  low severity/unburnt plots. 
  + **Beta**: High severity burns are more heterogeneous than low severity/unburnt plots.
  + **Gamma**: The total species pool is lowest in low severity/unburnt stands (except for lichens).
  + **Multiple burns** and **prescribed burns** have the highest bird diversity (alpha, beta and gamma), and similar to higher plant diversity.

* A majority of species with a strong preference for either high severity burns or low severity/unburnt stands also favor multiple burn and prescribed burnt plots, suggesting that such stands can provide suitable habitat for both cohorts of species. 


# Introduction

After a century of fire suppression, concerns are mounting over the effect of changing fire regimes on biodiversity in Western North American forests adapted to frequent, low to moderate severity fires [@haugoMissingFireQuantifying2019; @hessburgDryForestsWildland2005]. These changes result in two contrasting impacts: increasing extent of high severity fire on one hand, and the exclusion of fire on the other. The former threatens species and ecosystem services associated with mature forests [@millerAlteredFireRegimes2018; @millerPlantCommunityResponses2019], while the latter threatens early seral habitats and open forests [@swansonBiologicalAssociatesEarlyseral2014; @odionExaminingHistoricalCurrent2014; @knappLongtermOverstoryUnderstory2013]. Despite a broad concensus that the exclusion of fire has been detrimental to biodiversity, disagreement remains over how to balance the ecological need to allow more fire in fire-dependent ecosystems and the need to mitigate the risk of high severity fires to old growth-associated species, communities, and ecosystem services. 

Managers may turn to two approaches to achieve this balance and move away from total fire suppression. The active approach is to thin and burn stands to enhance populations of species negatively impacted by fire exclusion and minimize the likelihood of high severity fires in places where there is a concern over the vulnerability of resources and rural communities [@abellaEffectsTreeCutting2015; @kaliesTammReviewAre2016; @waymanInitialResponseMixedconifer2007; @websterLongtermVegetationResponses2010]. However, thinning and burning has been criticized on the grounds that reducing the extent of high severity fire could reduce the availability of ecologically-important early seral habitats, while at the same time disturbing mature forest habitats and threatening associated species [@bakerAreHighSeverityFires2015; @odionExaminingHistoricalCurrent2014]. The second approach is to let fires burn when appropriate; this passive approach could lead to more frequent fires, thus reducing fuel loading and canopy homogeneity [@northUsingFireIncrease2012]. Understanding the impacts of both active and passive forms of management is important to build a consensus over how to meet both fire management and biodiversity targets. 

Such concensus is particularly needed in the context of collaborative landscape management agreements that are becoming increasingly common, particularly on national forests. In the Klamath Mountains of northern California, the Karuk Tribe, United States Forest Service and community and environmental organizations have formed the Western Klamath Restoration Partnership (WKRP) in order to restore the historically low to mixed severity fire regime that prevailed prior to the disruption of Indigenous fire management [@fryInfluenceHumansClimate2006; @taylorSocioecologicalTransitionsTrigger2016; @crawfordLateHoloceneFire2015]. Extensive planning discussions have taken place to identify zones of agreement among all partners, such as limiting damage to communities from high severity fires and enhancing biodiversity (including both late-seral species and fire-dependent, early-seral species) [@harlingWesternKlamathRestoration2014]. But can management achieve both of these objectives, or are there necessarily trade-offs?

Studies from related forest types such as inland dry forests suggest that treatments that reduce canopy cover promote biodiversity [@bartuszevigeSynthesisKnowledgeEffects2009], but such results are inconsistent [@willmsEffectsThinningBurning2017] and their applicability to mixed-severity forests is questionable [@hessburgTammReviewManagement2016]. In this study, I surveyed biodiversity (birds, plants, lichens and insects) in long-unburnt stands and low severity and high severity single burns. I identified species associated with high severity burns and long unburnt stands as early- and late-seral species respectively. I also surveyed thinned and burnt stands and multiple burns with intermediate canopy cover representative of forest restoration goals aimed at minimizing the risk of high severity burns. To determine whether this type of management is also compatible with biodiversity conservation objectives, I then ask: do areas with intermediate canopies (actively or passively managed) provide habitat for early-seral species, late-seral species, both or neither?
